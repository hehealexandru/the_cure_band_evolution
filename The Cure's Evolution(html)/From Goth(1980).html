    <h1>
        <i>1980:From Goth...
    </i>   
</h1>
<hr>
<p>The Cure enter in the 80s not the darkness peddlers of legend but as a band in love with infected punk of <i>Buzzcocks</i> or <i>Elvis Costello</i>. 
<br>The early singles and the first album, released in 1979, <i>Three Imaginary Boys</i> gained them buzz but little else. </p>
<p>Released in 1980 their second album <i>Seventeen Seconds</i> and, specifically, single <i>A Forest</i>, would be where The Cure moved towards a darker and atmospherical direction. </p>        
<p>From a position of hindsight, the album's inspiration seems to be spanser, more atmospheric side of post-punk of <i>Wire</i> and <i>Joy Division</i> 
but Smith spent the composition of the album listening and shaping trough the additional influence
of <i>Five Leaves Left</i> by <i>Nick Drake</i> , <i> Isle of White live album</i> by <i>Jimi Hendrix</i> , <i> Astral Weeks</i> by <i>Van Morrison</i> and most of all, <i>Low</i> by <i> David Bowie</i>.</p>
<p>As a song, <i> A Forest</i> is not built around a hook or a chorus but an overarching mood that of isolation and loneliness. The instrumentation of the track consists of an ample use of flange guitar
with relay added, for a minimalist yet expansive sound. Synth washes sit on the track like rising mist, Lol Tolhurst's drums sound hauntingly flat and breathless, 
and Simon Gallup's ominous bass line stalks the track.</p>
<p>Smith noted in 2004:</p>
<h2><q>With <i> A Forest</i> I wanted to do something that was really atmospheric, and it had a fantastic sound.
[Label owner] Chris Parry said: "If you make this sound radio friendly, you've got a big hit on your hands." I said "But this is how it sounds.
It's the sound I've got in my head. It doesn't matter about whether it's radio friendly"</q> <br> <i>Robert Smith, Rolling Stone (June 2004)</i></h2>
<p>Of the band's limited seven days in the studio, a whole day was spent mixing <i> A Forest</i> such was Smith's devotion to the track.
His faith was rewarded, as the song was their debut entry in the UK Single Chart, reaching number 31 and allowing them to appear on <i>Top Of The Pops</i>.
The studio version of the track is now somewhat overpowerded by denser, more epic live versions, such as the one present on <i> Concert The Cure live</i> 
or theri overextended 11 minute rendition at Rock Werchter, known by most as the <i> Fuck Robert Palmer</i> mix.</p>
<p>Despite their hatred for critical labeling, <i>A Forest</i> was the first moment The Cure could be called goth, and the band would get darker and darker with 
their new two releases.</p>
<hr>
<p>In 1982 The cure released <i>Pornography</i>. If The Cure's more goth music is considered "suicidal", then <i>Pornography</i> is inches from 
the endless abyss of oblivion, both sonicaly and literally for the band themselves. It's cacophonous drumming and icy synthwork combined to create
some of the most viscerally unsettling music of their career.</p>
<h2><pre><q>It doesn't matter if we all die
    Ambition in the back of a black car
    In a high building there is so much to do
    Going home time, a story on the radio</q></pre></h2>
<p>They had cemented their reputation for being a gloomy doomy, dismal kinda band, and it had drained Smith: </p>
<h2><q>When we came to do <i>Pornography</i>, I really thought that was it for the group. I wanted to make the ultimate fuck-off record,
then The Cure would stop.</q> <br> <i>Robert Smith, Never Enough: The Story of The Cure (2006)</i></h2>
<p>After taking too many drugs in the assumed last Cure tour, bassist Simon Gallup departed, and Smith returned to a mounth-long detox and wrote
the pop-leaning <i>Let's Go To Bed</i>.
