        <i>1989:And Back...
    </i>
</h1>
    <hr>
        <p>By 1989, Smith had grown bored with the pop centric new wave that his band had been producing
            and had retched up some more dark feelings to put to music. His main concern was that he had yet to 
            make his masterpiece and that all bands he loved, respected and was influenced by had created theirs before they turned 30,
            before their inevitable decline took hold. In Smith's opinion, 
            <i>Bowie
        </i>'s work fizzeld out after 
            <i>Low
        </i> released in its 30th year,
            <i>Buzzcock
        </i>'s Pete Shelley was 23 when he releasede
            <i>Ever Fall In Love (With Someone You Should't've)
        </i>, while
            <i>Joy Division
        </i>'s Ian Curtis would be dead by then, leaving behind both
            <i>Unknown Pleasures
        </i> and 
            <i>Closer
        </i>.    
    </p>
<p>It was definite fear for Smith and this milestone was quickly approaching, so in 1988 on his 29th birthday he began
    writing what would become The Cure's defining statement,
        <i>Disintegration
    </i>.
        <br>Quizzed about its meaning, Smith stated about the album's title: 
    </p>
<h2>
    <q>And it's just about the sense of falling apart that I can't ever seem to shake off. But I think it's true for everyone, really.
        I just wanted the group, if we were gonna do something else after the 
        <i>Kiss Me
    </i>album, I knew that I wanted us to do something that had a bit of intensity to it so I could spend some time getting back into the
        things we used to do a few years ago, a bit more bite to them, rather than just sort-of pop stuff.
    </q>
</h2>
<p>By 1989 the band's lineup bore only one similarity tot the band that released
    <i>Three Imaginary Boys
</i> a decade previous, Smith himself. The years since
        <i> Let's Go To Bed 
    </i> had expanded the band from duo to five piece, but making of 
            <i>Disintegration
        </i> forced Smith to finally give up on the one remaining link from their debut lineup, former drummer now
            keyboardist Lol Tolhurst.            
    </p>
<h2>
    <q>-So Paul had to delegate his keyboard parts to Lol, and Lol can't play keyboards.
        <br>- [Interviewer] Is there a danger of The Cure becoming a synth or keyboard group?
            <br>-What, with Lol playing? You gotta be joking...(laughs)
            I think he gives heart to anyone that can't play an instrument that they can still be in a group.
        </q>
</h2>
<p>His alcoholism and apparent disinterest in learning and improving at his instrument had made the rest of the band hostile
    towards him, and his place was filled with touring keyboardist Roger O'Donnell.
    After six years of preferring the sunnier side of the pop music spectrum, Robert Smith decided to go 
    back to where he was at the beginning of the decade.
        <i>Disintegration
    </i> is soaked in towering slabs of keyboards and monumental percussion. The chord progressions
        are affecting in how gradual they are.
</p>
<p>The whole album is a mood of its own:
    of dread, despair, hopelessness and nightmarish panic, bringing together all the emotions present of
    <i>Seventeen Seconds
</i>,
        <i>Faith

    </i>, and
        <i>Pornography

    </i> and fusing them into something new and interesting.
            <br>While the four singles all did very well, with 
                <i>Lovesong
            </i> and 
                    <i>Lullaby
                </i> showing that darkly-infused pop songs can still be big hits, the album's title track is the 
                most essential moment. The lyrics for 
                        <i>Disintegration
                    </i> were the first written for the album, around the time of Smith's 29th birthday.
                        In line with The Cure's tradition for thesis expanding epic titular tracks, it is eight
                        minutes plus of slow-burning alienation mixed with references to addiction, fame and infidelity.
                        If there was a song that could be interpreted as a kiss off to his fans, this was it. 
                            <br>Some of the final lyrics are:
                        </p>
<pre>
    <q>
        I leave you with photographs
        Pictures of trickery
        Stains on the carpet
        and stains on the scenery

        Songs about happines
        murmured in dreams
        And both of us knew
        how the ending would be
    </q>
</pre>
<p>
    Graeme Thomson in 2018 describe it thusly:
</p>
<h2>
    <q>
        Smith's voice moves from calm tenor to dislocated howl, as he unleashes the most 
        intense, involved lyric on an LP that often lets the music do the talking... 
        It is not just the end of a relationship.
        It sounds like the end of everything.
    </q>
        <br>

</h2>
<p>Critically and commercially,
    <i>Disintegration 
</i> is The Cure's greatest achivement. It sold three million records worldwide, and the resulting tour saw them selling
    out stadia internationally.
