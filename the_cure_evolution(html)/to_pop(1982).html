        <i>1982:To Pop...
    </i> 
</h1>
    <hr>
        <p>Depending on which interview with Smith you want to belive, the song was either a musical experiment, a label enforced hit attempt, or based on more recent interviews,
        a concious decision to go against the all-consuming rock of 
            <i>Pornography 
         </i>.
    </p>    
    <h2>
        <q>The only way I could get Cure music played on the radio was to make something that was radio-friendly 
            so 'Let's Go To Bed' was entierly designed [to do that]. It was the only time we've ever done it, to get us
            played on the radio, particularly in America. And It worked!
    </q>

        <p>The original demo dubbed 
            <i>Temptation 2

        </i>
            doesn't sound too dissimilar to what the band had made on
            <i>Pornography 
        </i>
            :thickly rythmic with a synth topping, the bassline and percussion seeming like a faster
            <i>She's Lost Control
    </i>
            by <i>Joy Division
        </i>.
    </p>
    <p>In its fully realized form 
            <i>Let's Go To Bed
        </i>'s
            funky synthpop and all too blunt satirical lyrics seemed aimed at sending up 
            <i>Duran Duran
        </i>
            . When asked about his greatest musical nemesis, in 2017 Smith stated:            
    </p>
    <h2>
        <q>It was generally 
            <i>Duran Duran
            </i>
            which is really sad because they loved us, and they used to come to our shows. 
            But they represented everything we hated: the whole glamorous 80s, consumer bullshit; 
            this horrorshow that we were up against. 
        </q>

    <p>Musically,
        <i>Let's Go To Bed 
    </i>
            may not be The Cure's best work, and chart wise only reach number 44 in the UK, but it's video featuring the band, 
            now a two-piece, dancing about like a drunken
        <i>Tears For Fears
    </i> 
            , and their willingness to experiment with the poppier new wave side of music would serve them well
            for the rest of the decade. Two other pop focused tracks followed in 1983:
            the
        <i>New Order
    </i>
            indebted
        <i>The Walk
    </i>
            and 
        <i>the Aristocats
    </i>
            jazz of 
        <i> The Lovecats
    </i>
            ,all later released as a compilation called
        <i>The Japanese Whispers    
    </i>.  
        <br>This new wave direction will make them progressively bigger worldwide, each new single 
            would be paired with a Tim Pope directed promotional clip, which in turn would be broadcast on MTV and increase the band's profile
            especially in the States.
</p>
    <p>The next few years would produce an enviable collection of singles:
        <i>In Between Days     
    </i>
        ,<i>Close To Me   
    </i>
            , a re-release of 
        <i> Boys Don't Cry 
    </i>,
        <i> Why Can't I Be You
    </i>
            , and finally their biggest hit thus far
        <i>Just Like Heaven   
    </i>.
