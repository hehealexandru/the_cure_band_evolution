                Some of it is. Some of it isn't. Obviously the ones where I drowned aren't from direct experience.

        <p>The Cure are weird. In fact that's part of their appeal. Thery're outsiders, the forgotten and the lost and so invite that subsection of society. But what makes this band especially weird is there's many different shapes of The Cure.            
        </p>
         <p>The muted greys of <i>Seventeen Seconds</i>, the candyfloss pinks of <i>Japanese Whispers</i>, trough the deep painted purple of pain and sorrow of <i>Disintegration</i>. Loved by both a cult-like fan base and the music listening public at large, they played by their own rules.
